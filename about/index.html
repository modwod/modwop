    <h1>About<h1>
    <h2>Modular</h2>
    <p>Eurorack is a global modular standard originally created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doepfer" target="_blank">Dieter Doepfer</a>. There are hundreds of eurorack module designers & manufactures all over the world, from DIY hobbiest, to single person shops, to dedicated Eurorack modular companies.</p>
    <p>[Photo: circuit board sketch] The musical art that is derived from a Modular system starts with an idea for a unique musical module that aims to make, manipulate or modulate sound in a special or unique way.</.p>
    <p>[Photo: circuit board] That idea is then planned and designed onto a circuit board.</p>
    <p>[Photo: Make Noise Maths] The front panel of the module is the interface to the unique circuits that were planned on the board, sometimes with merely simple labels for what each jack does, or sometimes a work of art all by itself.</p>
    <p>[Photo: patched & lit-up Eurorack system] A modular system itself, is a work of art, as each module has to be chosen, placed and planned as far as how it will be patched together in the overall musical instrument.</p>
    <p>[Photo: Modular Music Event] And of course, the modular music performace is a work of art in and of itself. </p>
    <p>The musical styles and compositions are endless, from more traditonal, danceable 4 on the floor Electronic Dance Music to more abstract and ambient. </p>
    <h3>Modular Wopatui</h3>
    <p>modwop.com aims to teach, play, perform and grow the art of modular synethsis.</p>
